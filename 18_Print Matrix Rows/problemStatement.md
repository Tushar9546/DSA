Description

You are given a matrix of size N x M. You have to print all the odd indexed rows.

Note: Indexing in the matrix starts from 0.


Input
The first line of the input contains N and M, the dimensions of the matrix.

The next N lines contain M elements each denoting the elements of the matrix.

Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 100

1 <= A[i][j] <= 100


Output
Print all the even indexed rows in the matrix. Each row must be printed on a single line.


Sample Input 1 

4 3
1 2 3 
4 5 6
7 8 9
10 11 12
Sample Output 1

4 5 6
10 11 12
Hint

In the given matrix, there is only one row with odd indexes, with index 1.

Therefore, the output is4 5 6, the elements in the first row.
