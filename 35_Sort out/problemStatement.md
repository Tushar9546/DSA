Description

Given an array A of non-negative integers of size **m**. Your task is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and print out the original indices of the new sorted array.

Example:

A={4,5,3,7,1}

After sorting the new array becomes A={1,3,4,5,7}.

The required output should be "4 2 0 1 3"

NOTE: The indexing of the array starts with 0.

You can only write your own sorting algorithm must not use builtin functionality of sort()
