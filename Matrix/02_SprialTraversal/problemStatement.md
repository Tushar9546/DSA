Note : You don't have to take the input
Just complete the function and print the required output 

Input
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains N, the size of the matrix.

The next N lines contain N integers each denoting the values of the matrix.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 500

1 <= A[i][j] <= 500


Output
For each test case, print the spiral traversal of the matrix, as shown in the problem description, on a single line, on a new line.
