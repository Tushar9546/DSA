Description

You are given an arrayAwithNelements. You are allowed toremove only one element, which makes thesum of all the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Your task is to find thefirst index of smallest elementthat can be removed from array. If there is no answer print-1.


Input
Input Format

The first line contains a single integerN.

Next line contains N space separated integers A[k] , (0 <= k < N).

Constraints

1 <N< 100000

0 <A[k]< 1000000000


Output
Output Format

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element that CAN be removed, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!

Hint

Sample 1 Explanation
