Input
Input Format

First line contains n and k separated by space

Second line contains strings of length n.

Constraints

1 <= n <=10^6

1 <= k <= 100


Output
Print count of sub arrays.

4 3
2 3 4 6
Sample Output 1

1
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

There is only one longest possible subarray of size 3 i.e. {3, 4, 6} having a sum 13, which is not divisible by K = 3.
