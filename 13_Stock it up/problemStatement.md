Description

Due to recent pandemic announcement we need to make a stock requirement generator, where all the items required for a week with price are given.

For one week:

1. Flour = 5kg| Price = 110 per kg

2. Rice = 2kg| Price = 120 per kg

3. Sugar = 2kg| Price = 42 per kg

4. Pulse = 3kg| Price = 53 per kg

5. Bread = 2 packet | Price = 40 per packet

6. Milk = 5 litre| Price = 32 per litre

7. Oil = 2 litre| Price = 126 per litre

The user will give N number of weeks for stock calculation with a list of 7 elements with 0 and 1 representing each item in the list, if the element is 0 then that item is not required by the person.

The output should be the overall cost of the items for that number of weeks.
